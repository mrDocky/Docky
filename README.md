- 👋   Hi, I’m Yulian Stefanov,for friends I am just Docky.
- 👀   I am curious by nature, but we will talk about my interests later and in person.
- 🌱   I study Python.
- 💞️   I am looking to collaborate with enthusiasts who want to change the future of humans and our planet by: 
   -   reducing human exploitation and shifting most of the work to robots; 
   -   improve the cleanliness of the environment and, at the same time, increase the quality, purity and usefulness of food; 
   -   enable a person to develop his intellectual potential from an early age, and by developing medicine that cares about the person 
   rather than striving to take as much money as possible and from where he can, with the excuse that 
   "everything is in the interest of our health and everything possible is being done to help".
-  📫  How to reach me ...  Whoever has a real desire will find a way to contact me.
